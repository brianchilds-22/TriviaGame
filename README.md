# TriviaGame

I created a Colorado Rockies trivia game. Screen one is the start screen with a button that starts the game and the countdown. The second screen has the countdown that starts at 120 seconds followed by 10 questions about the Rockies with a done button to finish the quiz. Screen three is the results screen showing the number of correct, incorrect and unanswered questions.
